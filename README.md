# ðŸš€ CrisisAlert AI

This project is designed to **assist emergency responders** by classifying tweets into relevant disaster-related categories using **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The solution involves **data processing, model training, and a Flask-based web application** to provide real-time classification.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

This project is divided into three main stages:  

1. **Data Processing (ETL Pipeline)**  
   - Extracts data from CSV files  
   - Cleans and transforms the dataset  
   - Stores the processed data in an **SQLite database**  

2. **Machine Learning Pipeline**  
   - Loads and processes the data  
   - Trains a **classification model** to categorize messages into **36 different disaster-related categories**  
   - Saves the trained model for deployment  

3. **Flask Web Application**  
   - A user-friendly **Flask web app** that allows users to input a message and classify it in real-time  
   - Visualizes classification insights using **Plotly**
